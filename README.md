# 1. Developmental process 
### 1.1 Initial Steps
#### Project ideas & inspirations
<p>Initially, the idea was to build a project of any kind. Through long discussions it was decided that the best project to invest time in would be something that provided a learning potential for front-end, back-end, and also database development. For this case, the thought that got the most attention was to build some sort of social network, where the level of complexity could be adjusted to [UNDER CONSTRUCTION...]</p>

<p>Besides that, it would be ideal if the project could be completed using tools that were already known by the developers even if only to a lesser degree, since time available was not abundant and learning something completely new could require sometimes months in order to reach an adequate level of comfort with the tool.</p>

### 1.2 Front-end

#### Design
<p>The decision was to first start the project with the front-end, and building a design would be the first step.</p>
<p>That was made using the free version of <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>, allowing for the completion of a base template of the UI.</p>

#### Prototyping
<p>With a well developed design of how the front-end should look, the coding process was initialized focusing only in making something that looked good in both desktop and mobile screen sizes, the functionalities of everything, like toggleable buttons and animations comes in later.</p>
<p>In order to assist the construction of the UI, <a href="https://react.dev">React</a> was the framework of choice, allowing for a shorter development time with a more organized codebase. </p>
